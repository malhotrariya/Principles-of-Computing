# HW-2 Loops and String
This assignment involves coding over following concepts:

## drawIllusion(canvas)
To create a Tkinter function to draw an illusion using overlapping squares. The challenge is to use a loop systematically, avoiding hardcoded values

## partialProduct(n, x)
Implement partialProduct to calculate the product of consecutive integers from n to x. Use a for loop without relying on built-in math library functions

## printDiamond(n)
Develop printDiamond to print an ASCII art diamond based on a positive integer n. Challenges include understanding the pattern and using loops effectively

## printPrimeFactors(x)
Utilize a specific algorithm in printPrimeFactors to print prime factors of a positive integer x in a formatted manner

## Repeating Pattern
Design repeating pattern to draw on a Tkinter canvas within a grid of squares. Follow constraints, including using loops and having alternate versions of the pattern

## getSecretMessage(s, key)
Creating getSecretMessage to extract a hidden message in a text using a specified key. The task involves looping over characters and reconstructing the original message
