# HW-3 Data Structures and Efficiency
The assignment contains coding on the following topics:

## Lists and Methods
Implement onlyPositive(lst) to extract positive elements from a 2D list

## References and Memory
Write addToEach(lst, s) to modify a list of strings by concatenating a specified string s to each element

## Recursion
Develop recursiveLongestString(lst) to find the longest string in a list using recursion

## Dictionaries
- Create generateBubbles(canvas, bubbleList) to draw bubbles on a Tkinter canvas based on a list of dictionaries
- Write getBookByAuthor(bookInfo, author) to find a book by a given author in a dictionary mapping book titles to authors
- Implement makeIMDB(actorList, movieList) to create a dictionary mapping actor names to movie names based on two lists
