# Principles-of-Computing
Homework for CMU's Python Course 15110
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110/ 

## Core Learnings
1. **Programming constructs:** sequencing, selection, iteration, and recursion
2. **Data organization:** arrays and lists. Use of abstraction in computing: data representation, computer organization, computer networks, functional decomposition, and application programming interfaces
3. **Use of computational principles in problem-solving:** divide and conquer, randomness, and concurrency
4. Classification of computational problems based on complexity, non-computable functions, and using heuristics to find reasonable solutions to complex problems
5. Social, ethical and legal issues associated with the development of new computational artefacts
